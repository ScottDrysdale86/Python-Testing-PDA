### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.

# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.:
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc.

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer.

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # missing second = to compare values
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
      # should be a : after else
    else
      return False

  # dif should be def
  # Should have a , after card1
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  # lines below should be indented more
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    # card should be card1
    return card
  else:
    return card2


# def should be indented 1 more tab. In line with the above def
def cards_total(self, cards):
  # total has not been declared. Should be total = 0
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    # return should be on the same indentation as for to return the total
    # cannot concatenate total as it is an integer.
    return "You have a total of" + total

```
